# Workyard's Take Home Project

Hey there, I'm Sam. I'm a web developer at Workyard and a medium pace bowler for the Killara Bingles Cricket Club. I'll be guiding you through this take home project.

## The Mission

The mission, should you choose to accept, is to build a "Post a Project" modal in React. We'll POST your new projects to Workyard's staging API. After the project is successfully posted, we'll show all your new projects in a list of very simple cards.
