# Workyard's Take Home Project



Hey there, I'm Sam. I'm a web developer at Workyard and a medium pace bowler for the Killara Bingles Cricket Club. I'll be guiding you through this take home project.

## The Mission

The mission, should you choose to accept, is to build a "Post a Project" modal in React. We'll POST your new projects to Workyard's staging API. After the project is successfully posted, we'll show all your new projects in a list of very simple cards.

## Getting started on your machine

The first step is to fork this repo so that a fork exists on your own GitHub account. After you have forked the repo, clone your forked version down onto your machine.

Install the repo's dependencies:

`npm install`

Then start a local server:

`npm start`

You should be able to see the app on port 8000! Woooo.

## So why are we doing this?

This is a tangible way for you to show us:

* That you know react and redux.
* That you're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck and can communicate technical concepts clearly.
* That you're excellent at making web apps look like the designs given to you.
* That you're able to stick to coding conventions in an existing codebase.

## The Mission Specs

If you have Sketch, you can download the designs here: https://drive.google.com/a/wurble.com.au/file/d/1X569xGMtO_rYW5BBI2-frOxaacaQZm1K/view?usp=sharing

If you don't have Sketch, here are some images of what we'll be building:
