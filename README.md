# Workyard's Take Home Project

Hey there, I'm Sam. I'm a web developer at Workyard and a medium pace bowler for the Killara Bingles Cricket Club. I'll be guiding you through this take home project.

## The Mission

The mission, should you choose to accept, is to build a "Post a Project" modal in React. We'll POST your new projects to Workyard's staging API. After the project is successfully posted, we'll show all your new projects in a list of very simple cards.

## Getting started on your machine

The first step is to fork this repo. After you have forked the repo, clone your forked version down onto your machine.

Install the repo's dependencies

`npm install`

Then start a local server:

`npm start`
